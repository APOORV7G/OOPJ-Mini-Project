# 🚀 Space Control Simulator 3000 

> "Houston, we have a program!" 🛸

## 🌟 About
This is a totally-not-boring space control simulator where you can pretend you're NASA (but with a smaller budget). Control your very own satellite without the stress of actually losing billions in equipment!

## 🛠️ Features
- 🚀 Launch satellites (and pray they don't explode)
- 🛬 Land them (hopefully in one piece)
- ⛽ Refuel mid-mission (no space gas stations required)
- 📡 Transmit data (probably just space memes)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher (because we're not cavemen)
- Your favorite IDE (or notepad if you're feeling adventurous)
- A sense of humor

## 🎮 Controls
- **Launch**: Yeet that satellite into space
- **Land**: Bring it back home (gently!)
- **Refuel**: Because running out of fuel in space is not cool
- **Transmit Data**: Send those sweet, sweet space bytes

## ⚠️ Warning
No satellites were harmed in the making of this simulator. However, we cannot guarantee the same for your CPU.

Feel free to use this code for your own space adventures! Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility... and occasional null pointer exceptions.
